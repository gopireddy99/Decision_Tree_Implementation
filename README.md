# Decision Tree Classification using Scikit-learn
üìå Overview
This project focuses on implementing a Decision Tree Classifier using Python's scikit-learn library. The goal is to train a model, visualize its structure, and evaluate its performance on a classification task.

üìÇ Dataset
We use the Iris dataset, a well-known classification dataset available in scikit-learn. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

The task is to classify each flower into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

‚öôÔ∏è Steps Implemented
Data Loading: Imported the dataset and converted it into a pandas DataFrame for easy handling.

Preprocessing: Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Training: Created a DecisionTreeClassifier instance and trained it on the training data.

Visualization: Used plot_tree() to visualize the trained decision tree and understand the decision-making process.

Evaluation: Evaluated the model on the test data using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

üìä Results
The model achieved 100% accuracy on the test set (Iris dataset).

Confusion matrix showed perfect classification across all three classes.

Visualization illustrated how the model split data based on feature thresholds.

üîç Analysis
The decision tree performed very well on this small and clean dataset. It also provided clear visual insights into how the model makes predictions. While this model worked perfectly on the Iris dataset, real-world data may require additional steps like pruning or setting max_depth to avoid overfitting.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This project shows how easy it is to build and visualize a decision tree using scikit-learn. Decision Trees are powerful tools for classification tasks, especially 
when interpretability is important.
